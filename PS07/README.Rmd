## Check Out This Plot

This plot shows visually the expectation that **airtime has a direct correlation to distance**. It also shows trends in flight length by airport; for example Newark and JFK have similar flight spreads while LaGuardia flights are noticeably shorter in time and distance. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = distance, y = air_time, color = origin))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)+
  labs(title = "Air time vs Distance", subtitle = "2013 NYC Flights")+
  xlab("Distance (miles)")+
  ylab("Airtime (minutes)")
```
